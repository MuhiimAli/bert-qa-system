Some weights of DistilBertForQA were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['distilbert.qa_outputs.bias', 'distilbert.qa_outputs.weight', 'distilbert.qa_type.bias', 'distilbert.qa_type.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
